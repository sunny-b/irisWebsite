# irisWebsite

This is a portfolio website I built for my girlfriend,
who is a UI/UX and graphic designer.

For this build I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(w/JQuery)
and some PHP to help organize my files. Since this was my
first major build, the code could use some work to make it
more efficient and succinct. 

Once I learn more node.js and server-side node I will revisit
it and improve the performance speed.
