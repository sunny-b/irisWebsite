				<h3>Hi there! My name is Iris Sprague, a visual and UI/UX designer specializing in type and lettering.</h3>
				<p id="headline">Hi there! My name is Iris Sprague, a visual and UI/UX designer specializing in type and lettering.</p>
				<p>A little bit about myself:</p>
				<p>Born and raised in New Jersey, I first became intrigued with art after watching my father paint landscapes and people, he took me into his tutelage. However, it was design and lettering that became my true calling.</p>
				<p>It wasn’t until college that my simple hobby quickly developed into a passion, and then to an obsession. This lead to my receiving an undergraduate degree in Graphic Design from Montclair State University and jump started my career in the NYC design scene.</p>
				<p>In 2013, in spite of years of experience, working for companies such as Marvel and Vayner Media, I realized that I craved more knowledge in the field that I adore. So in the fall of the same year I found myself at the Maryland Institute College of Arts (MICA) getting my masters in GD.</p>
				<p>Since then I have been recognized in international competitions,such as Communication Arts Typographic Annual and have worked with and studied from world renowned designers Ken Barber, Ellen Lupton, and Tal Leming. Furthermore, I created a pop-up type foundry, Rope, with fellow classmate and type designer Shiva Nallaperumal. </p>
				<p>Nowadays you can find me in Seattle, still obsessively designing, lettering and creating typefaces - <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.instagram.com/irissprague/">take a look.</a> Feel free to connect with me via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:irissprague@gmail.com">email</a>, or through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/irissprague">Behance</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sprague_iris">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/irissprague1" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iris-sprague-74426a36">LinkedIn</a>.
